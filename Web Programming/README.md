# Web Programming

## Project Overview
This project involved designing and developing a custom website on a topic of my choice, using a range of modern web technologies. I selected the subject of video games, building a WordPress-based website hosted on an AWS server for video game blogging. The site featured custom post creation and account management functionalities, allowing users to submit and highlight specific games.
