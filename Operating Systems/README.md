# Operating Systems

## Project Overview
The Operating Systems (OS) project involved creating a scheduler simulation, representative of what a typical OS might use for processing tasks. Working in a team of three, we tested several OS scheduling techniques to evaluate the efficiency of each algorithm. These included First In, First Out (FIFO), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Round Robin (RR). To perform the simulation, arrays were used to represent hypothetical CPU threads, and performance was assessed based on factors such as thread count, memory availability, and processing speed. The folder contains the portion of the project I worked on, particularly designing and implementing the boilerplate template for all core algorithms, with a specific focus on the development of the SJF algorithm.
