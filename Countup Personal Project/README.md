# Countup!

## Project Overview
Countup! is a simple video game where the player is given a card value and wagers whether the "card" they drew has a higher score than the dealer's card. The player can interact with dialogue buttons to learn more about the dealer's hand, improving their chances of guessing correctly. The main objective of this project was to gain experience with Java's GUI tools and to build the game entirely in Java.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Java Swing and AWT (GUI)

## Folder Structure
The workspace contains two folders, where:
- `src`: Contains the source code.
- `resources`: Contains the non-code assets, such as images, text files, and other media used by Countup.
